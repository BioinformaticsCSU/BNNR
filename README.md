# BNNR
BNNR is a novel computational method, which utilizes Bounded Nuclear Norm Regularization algorithm to identify potential novel indications for known or new drugs. The code in this package implements Bounded Nuclear Norm Regularization (BNNR) for drug repositioning, which is implemented in Matlab2014a.
