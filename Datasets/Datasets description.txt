BNNR can conduct drug-disease predictions on three datasets: Fdataset, Cdataset and DNdataset, which can be loaded by matlab.

(1) Fdataset
Wrname: the DrugBank IDs of drugs;

Wdname: the OMIM IDs of diseases;

drug: drug similarity matrix;

disease: disease similarity matrix;

didr: disease-drug association matrix.

(2) Cdataset
Wrname: the DrugBank IDs of drugs;

Wdname: the OMIM IDs of diseases;

drug: drug similarity matrix;

disease: disease similarity matrix;

didr: disease-drug association matrix.

(3) DNdataset
Wrname: the names of drugs;

Wdname: the names of diseases;

drug: drug similarity matrix;

disease: disease similarity matrix;

didr: disease-drug association matrix.
